Git is basically a blockchain.  The only thing that is missing is the
proof-of-work bit.  We can easily add that to git using a pre-receive
hook.  This repository contains a sample pre-receive hook.

Unless you are really lucky, you might want to run something like this
instead of "git push":

    until git push origin main
    do
        sleep 1
	git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
    done

However, if you attempt to push multiple commits at once, you need
something more elaborate.
